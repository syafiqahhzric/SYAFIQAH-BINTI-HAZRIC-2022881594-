<p><center>For my parents both are from Perlis.I am the eldest of four siblings.In the picture above consists of my uncle, aunt and cousin.</center></p>
<p><center>I am the first grandchild in my family and the oldest among my cousins</p></center>
<p><center>My family will always gather during holidays, but it is quite challenging for everyone to come together because some live far away in Johor. 
<p><center>Nevertheless, we still make an effort to find the time and opportunity to meet during holidays and festive celebrations.
